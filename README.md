# Gobode-Labs

**Gobode-Labs** is an ecosystem of symbolic tools for runtime analysis, threat detection, and adaptive intelligence. It includes:

- **TRECEpoint**: A symbolic debugger that uses summation logic to classify runtime behavior.
- **Symbolic Engine**: A Σ-based reasoning engine for threat detection and memory analysis.
- **DAC Module**: Converts symbolic events into analog signals for IoT and real-time feedback.
- **Smart Tools**: Hex editor, memory visualizer, and symbolic network monitor.

## Vision

To build a new kind of intelligence — one that feels its own execution, adapts symbolically, and bridges code, physics, and cognition.
